# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data
New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors 
such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.
In this project we have investigated:
1. Racial differences in SAT scores.
2. Gender differences in SAT scores.
3. Relationship between the Advanced Placement (AP) scores and SAT scores.
